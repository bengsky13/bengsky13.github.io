I am a security researcher and developer based in **Bekasi, Indonesia**, with a passion for uncovering vulnerabilities and understanding how systems work at a low level. My primary focus is on **Web Security**.

### What I Do

I actively participate in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions and perform security research, specializing in:

* **Web Exploitation:** Researching XSS (including complex DOM-based vectors), SQL Injection, and bypassing WAFs.

Beyond security, I am an experienced **Luau scripter** for the Roblox platform, developing custom systems ranging from voice chat implementations to complex UI frameworks.
